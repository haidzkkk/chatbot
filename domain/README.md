# Domain

The Domain module defines the business logic of the application. It is a module that is independent of the development platform i.e. it is written purely in the programming language and does not contain any elements from the platform. The reason for that is that Domain should only be concerned with the business logic of the application, not with the implementation details. This also allows for easy migration between platforms, should any issues arise.

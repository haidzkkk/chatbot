What is Android?

![source from https://www.android.com](<../.gitbook/assets/unnamed (1).webp>)

The platform changing what mobile can do. When a device goes from just working to actually making life easier, Android is behind it. It’s the reason your GPS avoids traffic, your watch can text and your Assistant can answer questions. It’s the operating system inside 2.5 billion active devices. Everything from 5G phones to stunning tablets, Android powers them all.

Android is open to everyone: developers, designers and device makers. That means more people can experiment, imagine and create things the world has never seen.

When you have Android, you have security that’s right there out of the box and never stops working. Google Play Protect scans all your apps, the software gets regular security updates and the platform is always improving. It’s like a security guard that never takes a break, a nap or a vacation.

On Android, you get to decide when and if your data is shared, like your Web & App Activity or Location History. If an app accesses your location while you are not using it, you’ll get a notification. And if you ever want to change permissions, all your Privacy settings are in one place. It’s privacy, with you in the driver’s seat.

With Digital Wellbeing, you get the tools to understand how you use your phone and decide what works for you. Whether that means unplugging, cutting down distractions or just winding down before bed.

The dashboard is a great example. It gives you a snapshot of your screen time, notifications, how often you unlock your phone and more. And it’s just one of the many tools you get with Digital Wellbeing.

Everyone has their own way of using their devices. That’s why we build accessible features and products that work for the various ways people want to experience the world. Screen readers, sound mufflers, even AR walking guides. Because when it comes to technology, there’s no one-size-fits all.

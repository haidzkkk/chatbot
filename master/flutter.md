# Flutter

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for [mobile](https://flutter.dev/docs), [web](https://flutter.dev/web), [desktop](https://flutter.dev/desktop), and [embedded](https://flutter.dev/embedded) devices from a single codebase.

#### Fast Development

Paint your app to life in milliseconds with Stateful Hot Reload. Use a rich set of fully-customizable widgets to build native interfaces in minutes.

#### Expressive and Flexible UI

Quickly ship features with a focus on native end-user experiences. Layered architecture allows for full customization, which results in incredibly fast rendering and expressive and flexible designs.

#### Native Performance

Flutterâ€™s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons, and fonts, and your Flutter code is compiled to native ARM machine code using [Dart's native compilers](https://dart.dev/platforms).
